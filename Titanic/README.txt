This is the code for predicting a passenger's survival rate on the Titanic given their different attributes. This was done for a Kaggle competition. The training and test data were provided by Kaggle. Each row describes a person and contains details about them like sex, age, class of travel etc. Based on my knowledge of the disaster i selected some features from the complete list (e.g women and children were given preferrence to get on a lifeboat etc) and applied logistic regression to make my predictions. I got an accuracy of 78% on my predictions.
